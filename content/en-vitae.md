# Professional Experience
I join Tri-ibiotech as an  application engineer for Phoenix, and provide technical support and training services for users across the country. 
* I hosted 11 WinNonlin workshops as the only lecturer, 
* organized 2 NLME workshop with others,
* 5 NONMEM workshops with others,
* conducted internal training for dozens of companies,
* Help customer translate their NONMEM model to PML model,
* Help customer Building a entero-hepatic reflux model,
* Help analyze fish PK data.

I also made some Phoenix cases published on the company's website, such as:
* how to use Phoenix to generate VPC Plot,
* how to use Phoenix for allometric scaling,
* how to use Phoenix building the Target-mediated drug disposition models.
